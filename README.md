# Contact-Form-
I built a dynamic contact form featuring real-time validation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This form captures user inputs efficiently while providing instant feedback to ensure accurate data submission. This project strengthened my skills in form validation, DOM manipulation, and enhancing web interactivity.
